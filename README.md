# pNEUMA
pNEUMA is a large-scale dataset of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles that have been collected by a one-of-a-kind experiment by a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece. 
A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over five days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not) and more than 30 bus stops.
